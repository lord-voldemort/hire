    overview: ! '<p>MongoDB is the leading NoSQL database. MongoDB&#8217;s open-source,
      document technology is popular among both developers and IT professionals given
      its agile and scalable approach. MongoDB features:</p>


      <p>JSON data model with dynamic schemas

      Auto-sharding for horizontal scalability

      Built-in replication and high availability

      Full, flexible index support

      Rich document queries

      Fast, in-place updates

      Aggregation framework and Map / Reduce

      GridFS for large file storage

      Organizations of all sizes use MongoDB to quickly and easily code, scale and
      operate applications. Instead of storing data in rows and columns as one would
      with a relational database, MongoDB stores a binary form of JSON documents (BSON).</p>


      <p>Relational databases impose flat, rigid schemas across entire tables. By
      contrast, MongoDB is an agile database that allows schemas to vary across documents
      and to change quickly as applications evolve, while still providing the functionality
      developers expect from relational databases, such as secondary indexes, a full
      query language and strong consistency.</p>


      <p>MongoDB is built for scalability, performance and high availability. Auto-sharding
      allows MongoDB to scale from single server deployments to large, complex multi-site
      architectures. Leveraging native caching and RAM, MongoDB provides high performance
      for both reads and writes. Built-in replication with automated failover enables
      enterprise-grade reliability and operational flexibility. MongoDB also provides
      a command line shell for interacting directly with the database, as well as
      drivers for most popular programming languages and frameworks to make development
      more natural.</p>


      <p>Benefits include:</p>


      <p>Increased developer productivity

      Better customer experience

      Accelerated time to market

      Reduced total cost of ownership (TCO)</p>'

    overview: ! '<p>MongoDB Monitoring Service</p>


      <p>MongoDB Monitoring Service (MMS) is a free cloud-based service provided by
      10gen for monitoring MongoDB deployments in real time. MMS features charts,
      custom dashboards and automated alerting to track performance, utilization and
      other KPIs. Designed specifically for MongoDB, MMS ensures that users have visibility
      into the right metrics to manage and optimize applications during development
      and in production. MMS requires minimal setup and configuration.</p>


      <p>Proactive Monitoring and Management</p>


      <p>MMS collects statistics on all key server and hardware indicators and presents
      the data in a powerful web console. MMS tracks over 100 metrics to monitor the
      health of MongoDB clusters. By default, the MMS dashboard displays 9 metrics:</p>


      <p>Op Counters – Count of operations executed per second

      Memory – Amount of data MongoDB is using

      Lock Percent – Percent of time spent in write lock

      Background Flush – Average time to flush data to disk

      Connections – Number of current open connections to MongoDB

      Queues – Number of operations waiting to run

      Page Faults – Number of page faults to disk

      Replication – Oplog length (for primary) and replication delay to primary (on
      secondary)

      Journal – Amount of data written to journal

      For customers with MongoDB Subscriptions, MMS enables 10gen engineers to monitor
      deployments on an ongoing basis and suggest corrective action before degradation
      occurs. MMS also helps shorten the response time for support issues. When customers
      file tickets with the 10gen support team, our engineers can examine their MMS
      data, enabling them to identify customers&#8217; configurations and any troubling
      signs about their clusters.</p>'

    user-uploaded music and photos. Their &#8220;patent-pending Cinematic Artificial
    Intelligence technology and high-end motion design&#8221; drives the web app.
    They say the Cinematic A.I. analyzes users&#8217; photos and music like an actual
    director and editor. For instance, to analyze music the genre, song structure,
    energy, rhythm, instrumentation, and vocals are all taken into consideration.</p>


    <p>Once completed, videos can be emailed, downloaded and embedded into other sites.
    The company says no two videos are ever the same.</p>


    <p>Animoto&#8217;s founders have a good amount of experience in the entertainment
    industry having produced shows for MTV, Comedy Central and ABC among other things.
    The company is based in New York City, but also has an office in San Francisco.</p>


    <p><a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/slide" title="Slide">Slide</a> and
    <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/rockyou" title="RockYou">RockYou</a>
    are Animoto&#8217;s biggest competitors, but the company sees them more as potential
    partners since neither is doing what Animoto is doing.</p>


    <p>In May 2008 Amazon funded the startup with an undisclosed amount.</p>


    <p>As of June 2008, Animoto videos can be purchased on DVD or downloaded in DVD-quality
    formats directly from the Animoto website, and users can enjoy their videos on
    computers, televisions, and even large projection screens.</p>'

    overview: <p>Animoto is a web application that, with the click of a button, produces
      videos using images and music that a user selects. Using their patent-pending
      Artificial Intelligence developed to think like an actual editor &amp; director,
      the resulting video has the emotional impact of a movie trailer and the visual
      energy of a music video.</p>

    New York city art dealer Larry Gagosian as an advisor and is negotiating with
    other world-class galleries to highlight their artists on Art.sy.</p>


    <p>Art.sy is powered by The Art Genome Project, an ongoing study of the characteristics
    that distinguish and connect works of art. Art.sy evaluates artworks along 200+
    characteristics—such as art-historical movements, subject matter, and formal qualities—to
    create a powerful search experience that reflects the multifaceted aspects of
    works of art.</p>


    <p>Art.sy&#8217;s investors and advisors include global leaders in the arts, media
    and technology. Investors include Dasha Zhukova, founder of Moscow&#8217;s Garage
    Center for Contemporary Culture; Wendi Murdoch, film producer; and Jack Dorsey,
    creator of Twitter. Advisors include Larry Gagosian, owner of Gagosian Galleries;

    <p>â€¢  Helping the Helpers: Case Commons, Inc. believes new technology must support
    the frontline workers who serve our nationâ€™s most vulnerable children and familiesâ€”not
    replace or hinder them</p>


    <p>â€¢  Measuring Results: Case Commons, Inc. will use the latest technology to
    improve the quality and timeliness of data so that policymakers and caseworkers
    can understand what works, and what doesnâ€™tâ€”and then use that knowledge to
    make smart choices</p>


    <p>In addition to continuing to develop Casebook for child welfare providers around
    the country, Case Commons, Inc. is helping to drive a broader conversation about
    how to improve technology innovation in government, ensuring that government technology

    that empowers and connects women through their own social selling experience.
    </p>


    <p>Launched in 2011, Chloe + Isabel is disrupting the traditional direct sales

    insights and recommendations to help support their businesses. </p>

    experience developing jewelry for major retailers in the United States, including
    Target Corp, Macy&#8217;s, Gap Inc, LVMH and Kenneth Cole. Waterbury, who supported
    herself through college by direct-selling, says she made the jump from working
    for multi-billion dollar retailers to launching a startup so she could empower
    the next generation of women.  </p>


    <p>In November 2011, Chloe + Isabel raised a $8.5 million Series A round of funding,

  :overview: ! '<p>Designer Pages is the new media platform and product management
    suite that empowers members of the architecture and design community to  work
    better together. Architects and designers can share information seamlessly, without
    the cumbersome, antiquated tools they formerly had to rely on, such as cutting
    and pasting links, bookmarking pages and sharing hard copies. </p>


    <p>Designer Pages puts the largest product portfolio in the world at their fingertips.
    Through project folders, each member of a project team can tap into the collective
    wisdom of the entire architecture and design community, breaking down silos of
    information within and between different firms, specialties, and geographies.
    </p>


    <p>By providing access to enhanced product search and save capabilities and the
    ability to generate collaborative virtual workspaces, Designer Pages is modernizing
    the way designers and suppliers do business. Conceived  as a user-generated platform
    that provides a more efficient way for designers to research and categorize products,
    Designer  Pages streamlines communication between colleagues, clients and suppliers.
    For suppliers, Designer Pages introduces a new way to organically network and
    connect with customers (designers) in real-time vs. slower, more traditional methods
    of driving visibility. Having the ability to post and update product listings
    freely while also benefiting from Designer Pages patent-pending contextual product
    placement technology, suppliers are offered a guaranteed first, second or third
    tier listing for relevant product listings. </p>'

  :overview: ! '<p>Desk.com makes it easy for teams and Whole Companies to support
    customers right from the browser, via email, phone, chat, web, Facebook and Twitter.</p>


    <p>The company provides hosted, cloud-based customer service platforms for delivering
    what the company calls &#8220;awesomely responsive&#8221; customer service. The
    company&#8217;s all-in-one system helps businesses of all sizes listen to and
    support customers in real time via email, self service FAQs, chat, and social
    networks like Twitter.</p>


    <p>Founded in 2009 by customer service automation veterans Alex Bard, Gary Benitt,
    Brad Birnbaum, and Jeremy Suriel, the venture-funded company released its first
    product in September 2010. It has been adopted by leading customer-oriented brands,
    including Twitter, DirecTV, Bonobos, and Grooveshark. </p>


    <p>Desk.com&#8217;s products emphasize social networking, whole company support,
    powerful agent tools, and web-based self-service. The Desk.com product is a real-time
    hosted system for both customer interaction management (CIM) and social customer
    relationship management (SCRM). The platform lets companies bring in support requests
    from multiple channels &#8211; Twitter, email, live chat, discussion forums, and
    so on &#8211; and consolidate them in one collaborative desktop that can be accessed
    by anybody in the organization. The system supports detailed case management (customer
    profiles, history, dispositioning, tracking) and interaction management (chat,
    email, callbacks, self service, knowledge base,  twitter, etc.). </p>


    <p>Desk.com&#8217;s built-in support for social networks makes it easy for companies
    to extend their support footprint to social channels like Twitter. Extensive web-based
    knowledge bases and Q&amp;A discussion forums lower the cost of support and allow
    customers to help themselves. Usage-based pricing  make it easy for companies
    to deliver support across all departments, not just customer service. Collaborative
    tools and unlimited flexible agent accounts help bring development, manufacturing,
    sales, marketing, and executives into the support-delivery process. </p>


    <p>Business rules, case filters, automation and bulk management tools help lower
    the cost of service while increasing overall quality. An integration system connects
    customer service interactions with web and mobile products, publicly accessible
    databases and private corporate databases. A robust API makes it easy to build
    customized integrations and more advanced applications.</p>


    <p>Desk.com offers the first full-time Agent entirely free, $1 per hour for flexible
    usage, and $49 per month for additional Agents. Special discounts for startups,
    non-profits. Built with the small and medium business in mind, also offers professional
    and enterprise-grade solutions for larger businesses and Fortune 500 companies.</p>'

  :overview: ! '<p>Foursquare is a geographical location based social network that
    incorporates gaming elements. </p>


    <p>Users share their location with friends by &#8220;checking in&#8221; via a
    smartphone app or by text message. Points are awarded for checking in at various
    venues. Users can connect their Foursquare accounts to their Twitter and Facebook
    accounts, which can update when a check in is registered. By checking in a certain
    number of times, or in different locations, users can collect virtual badges.
    In addition, users who have checked in the most times at a certain venue will
    be crowned &#8220;Mayor&#8221; until someone surpasses their number. Various venues
    have embraced Foursquare, and offer special deals to users who are &#8220;mayors&#8221;.
    </p>


    <p>Foursquare has applications for iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Windows Mobile
    7, Nokia S40 &amp; S60, as well as Samsung Bada.</p>

    overview: ! '<p>Gmail, also known as <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google"
      title="Google">Google</a> Mail, is a free email service provided by Google which
      has innovative features such as &#8220;conversation view&#8221; email threads,
      search-oriented interface, and plenty of free storage (almost 7.7GB). </p>


      <p>Gmail opened in private beta mode in April 2004 by invitation only. At first,
      invites were hard to come by and were spotted up for sale on auction sites like
      <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ebay" title="eBay">eBay</a>. The
      email service is now open to everyone and is part of <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/product/google-apps"
      title="Google Apps">Google Apps</a>.  <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/person/paul-buchheit"
      title="Paul Buchheit">Paul Buchheit</a>, an early employee at Google, is given
      credit for building the product.  </p>


      <p>One important Gmail feature is the organization, tracking, and recording
      users&#8217; contact lists. For instance, if you start typing the letter C into
      the &#8220;To&#8221; field Gmail will bring up via autocomplete a list of every
      email address and contact name starting with the letter. This feature helps
      when you can&#8217;t quite remember a name. Plus, Gmail automatically adds and
      updates email addresses and names to your contact list when you write emails.</p>


      <p>In June 2008, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/05/live-coverage-of-google-gmail-event/"
      title="Gmail Labs was introduced">Gmail Labs was introduced</a>. It&#8217;s
      a section within Gmail&#8217;s settings, and it lists new features that are
      rough and have gone through almost no filtering. Once it&#8217;s working it
      will go out to users in the next code build. The most popular add-ons will eventually
      be built into Gmail.</p>'

      without needing a specific date. Calendar can also be set-up to send you SMS
      or email alerts for upcoming calendar entries.</p>"

    overview: ! '<p>Google News is a computer-generated news site that aggregates
      headlines from more than 4,500 English-language news sources worldwide, groups
      similar stories together and displays them according to each reader&#8217;s
      personalized interests.</p>


      <p>Traditionally, news readers first pick a publication and then look for headlines
      that interest them. We do things a little differently, with the goal of offering
      our readers more personalized options and a wider variety of perspectives from
      which to choose. Google News offers links to several articles on every story,
      so readers can first decide what subject interests them and then select which
      publishersâ€™ accounts of each story theyâ€™d like to read. </p>


      <p>Articles are selected and ranked by computers that evaluate, among other
      things, how often and on what sites a story appears online. We also rank based
      on certain characteristics of news content such as freshness, location, relevance
      and diversity. As a result, stories are sorted without regard to political viewpoint
      or ideology and you can choose from a wide variety of perspectives on any given
      story. We&#8217;ll continue to improve Google News by adding sources, fine-tuning
      our technology and providing Google News to readers in even more regions.</p>

    overview: ! '<p>Google Product Search (formerly known as Froogle) is a price comparison
      service launched by <a href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google" title="Google">Google</a>.
      It is currently in beta test stage. It was invented by Craig Nevill-Manning.
      Its interface provides an HTML form field into which a user can type product
      queries to return lists of vendors selling a particular product, as well as
      pricing information. Product Search is only available for selected countries
      at this point.</p>


      <p>Google Product Search is different from most other price comparison services
      in that it neither charges any fees for listings, nor accepts payment for products
      to show up first. Also, it makes no commission on sales. Any company can submit
      individual product information via Google Base or can bulk submit items for
      inclusion. Google sells advertising through AdWords to be displayed in Product
      Search results adjacent to the unpaid results.</p>'

      built using Google&#8217;s core search technology, that prioritizes or restricts

      can be tailored to reflect your point of view or area of expertise. With a Custom
      Search Engine, you can:</p>


      <ul>

      <li>Apply your website&#8217;s look and feel to the search results page.</li>

      <li>Provide search refinements within results pages to make it easier for searchers
      to find the information they&#8217;re looking for.</li>

      <li>Add sites to your search engine&#8217;s index as you surf the web.</li>

      <li>Invite friends and trusted users to co-edit and contribute to your search
      engine.</li>

      <li>Make money from your Custom Search Engine by participating in Google&#8217;s
      AdSense program.</li>

      </ul>


      <p>Once you&#8217;ve defined your search engine index, Google will give you
      a simple piece of code for a search box to place on your site or blog. You&#8217;ll
      then have the option to choose various customization options to make the look
      and feel and functionality of your search engine your own.</p>

    overview: ! '<p>Google Translate is a beta service provided by Google Inc. to
      translate a section of text, or a webpage, into another language. </p>


      <p>The service limits the number of paragraphs, or range of technical terms,
      that will be translated. It is also possible to enter searches in a source language
      that are first translated to a destination language allowing you to browse and
      interpret results from the selected destination language in the source language.
      For some languages, users are asked for alternate translations such as for technical
      terms, to be included for future updates to the translation process. Text in
      a foreign language can be typed, and if &#8220;Detect Language&#8221; is selected,
      it will not only detect the language, but it will translate into English by
      default.</p>


      <p>If the user is translating English to French, for example, and the language
      needs to be swapped into reverse order (French to English), clicking &#8220;swap&#8221;
      will reverse the orientation of the language translation.</p>'

    overview: ! '<p>Google App Engine offers a full-stack, hosted, automatically scalable
      web application platform.  The service allows developers to build applications
      in Python, Java (including other JVM based languages such as JRuby) which can
      then use other Google services such as the Datastore (built on BigTable) and
      XMPP.  The service allows developers to create complete web application that
      run entirely on Google&#8217;s computing infrastructure and scale automatically
      as the application&#8217;s load changes over time.  Google also provides an
      SDK for local development and site monitoring tools for measuring traffic and
      machine usage.</p>

    overview: ! "<p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/sitesearch/\" title=\"Google Site
      Search\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Site Search</a> is a rebranding and enhancement
      of the existing Google Custom Search Business Edition.</p>\n\n<p>Google Site
      Search is intended for organizations that want to add Google search functionality
      to their websites. It has three main improvements over the former custom search
      offering: it allows for synonym matching, results tweaking, and indexing of
      so-called â€œdark webâ€\x9D content.</p>\n\n<p>If you a run a site that often
      refers to terms by their acronyms, or commonly uses different phrases to describe
      things, you can upload a list of synonyms to Google and it will treat them the
      same when a user searches within your site.</p>\n\n<p>If youâ€™re a news site
      that tends to place a premium on newer content, you can bias content based on
      its date, forcing the newest results to the top. Similarly, if youâ€™re an online
      retailer or provider of some other type of content, you can give preference
      to results for that content (in the online retailerâ€™s case, any product pages
      where visitors might go on to buy things).</p>\n\n<p>Google Site Search mainly
      relies on the standard Google crawler when scouring your site. But you can also
      hand it special sitemaps so that it recognizes areas of your website that might
      typically be overlooked by the crawler. These are results like those hidden
      behind forms or available only through intricate database queries.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps
      most compellingly, Google Site Search can be visually customized to match the
      look and feel of your website. This isnâ€™t a new feature (it existed in the
      previous business edition) but something perhaps overlooked by most site owners.
      When you implement site search, you can customize the appearance with a WYSIWYG
      editor, or even request a raw XML file that can be parsed and displayed anyway
      you want (you donâ€™t even have to include Google branding on your results pages).</p>"

      source_text: ! "Google today launched On-Demand Indexing, a new feature for
        Google Site\r\nSearch that allows businesses to quickly incorporate new pages
        and\r\nimportant site updates into search results on their websites. On-Demand\r\nIndexing
        ensures that site visitors have access to a site's freshest\r\ncontent, and
        that businesses have the flexibility to share news, product\r\nreleases and
        promotions as they happen.\r\n\r\nWith On-Demand Indexing:\r\n\r\n* Site owners
        get an \"Index Now\" button to quickly and easily update\r\ntheir site search
        results with new and updated content.\r\n* New pages are searchable within
        hours -- taking no longer than a\r\nday to appear within site search results.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn-Demand
        Indexing has allowed Adobe to easily keep their new\r\nonline Adobe Community
        Help\r\nup to date, creating a\r\ndynamic resource that combines Adobe's in-depth
        help centers with the\r\nmost current resources available online. With Google
        Site Search, Adobe\r\ncan selectively index the most relevant results from
        across their entire\r\nonline community, and expose these resources directly
        to their Creative\r\nSuite customers -- creating a unique tool that spans
        from the desktop\r\ninto the cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On-Demand Indexing was
        essential for our recent launch of Adobe\r\nCreative Suite 4, the biggest
        software release in the company's\r\nhistory,\" said Tanya Wendling, senior
        director for Learning Resources at\r\nAdobe. \"Google Site Search made it
        easy to implement search across our\r\nCreative Suite product line and online
        sites, and we are now able to\r\nindex thousands of new pages and make them
        available to millions of\r\nusers worldwide within hours.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle
        Site Search, our cloud-based search solution for business, helps\r\nthousands
        of organizations harness the power of Google.com, and fully\r\ncustomize search
        to suit their website. Along with the greater control\r\nof On-Demand Indexing,
        site owners get the same ease of use and fast\r\nresults of Google Site Search,
        including:\r\n\r\n* Set up that takes minutes and results returned in less
        than a second\r\n* The ability to promote new or certain types of pages at
        the top of\r\nresults\r\n* Full customization controls over the look and feel
        of search\r\n\r\n* A range of options for phone and email support"

      <p>GA can track visitors from all referrers, including search engines, display

      <p>Integrated with AdWords, users can optimize online campaigns by tracking
      landing page quality and conversions. Goals might include sales, lead generation,
      viewing a specific page, or downloading a particular file. These can also be
      monetized. By using GA, marketers can determine which ads are performing, and
      which are not, providing the information to optimize or cull campaigns.</p>'

    overview: ! "<p>Google Moderator, which launched on September 24, 2008, a simple
      tool that helps groups determine which questions should be asked at all hands
      meetings, conferences, Q&amp;A sessions, etc. The idea is that there are always
      lots of good questions to ask in a limited period of time, but itâ€™s hard to
      know which questions the attendees are most interested in hearing discussed.
      Moderator lets users add questions and vote on the questions of others, so the
      cream rises to the top.</p>\n\n<p>Moderator was an idea initially conceived
      by Taliver Heath as a side project and resides on <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/07/google-jumps-head-first-into-web-services-with-google-app-engine/\"
      title=\"Google App Engine\">Google App Engine</a>. He describes the product
      on the Google App Engine <a href=\"http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2008/09/introducing-google-moderator-on-app.html\"
      title=\"blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">blog</a>:</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;I designed a tool
      in my 20% time that would allow anyone attending a tech talk to submit a question,
      and then give other participants a way to vote on whether or not that question
      should be asked. This way, the most popular and relevant questions would rise
      to the top so that the presenter or the moderator of an event could run the
      discussion more efficiently and in a transparent manner. The tool, which we
      internally called â€œDoryâ€\x9D after our favorite question-asking fish in Finding
      Nemo, quickly grew to other parts of Google including our weekly all-hands company
      meeting, as well as for our series of talks led by political candidates or distinguished
      authors.&#8221;</p>"

    overview: ! '<p>Google Wave is a tool for communication and collaboration on the
      web, launching in the second half of 2009. Google announced that they would
      discontinue new development on Google wave in August 2010 and that waves would
      no longer be visible after April 30, 2012.</p>


      <p>In Google Wave, users create and invite other people to &#8220;waves.&#8221;
      Everyone on a wave can use richly formatted text, photos, gadgets, and even
      feeds from other sources on the web. They can insert a reply or edit the wave
      directly. It&#8217;s concurrent rich-text editing, where you see what other
      users on the wave are typing in real-time. That means Google Wave is just as
      well suited for quick messages as for persistent content—it allows for both
      collaboration and communication. You can also use &#8220;playback&#8221; to
      rewind the wave to see how it evolved.</p>'

    overview: ! '<p>Google Voice is a free Internet service that uses VoIP technology
      to link phone numbers together.  GrandCentral was relaunched as Google Voice
      on March 11, 2009 with new features, including voicemail transcriptions and
      SMS managing. </p>


      <p>Users of Google Voice are able to select a single U.S. phone number, from
      various area codes. When a Google Number is called, any or all of the user&#8217;s
      phones may be set to ring. Which phone(s) ring can be set based on the calling
      number, based on contact group, and/or based on time of day. The service includes
      various additional features, like centralized voicemail and indexable, automated
      voicemail transcription, accessible by PC or phone. </p>'

  :overview: ! '<p>ParkWhiz.com is the number one place to find and reserve a guaranteed
    parking space before you reach your destination. In addition, ParkWhiz creates
    software to help parking owners manage and market their parking using the ParkWhiz
    website, mobile apps, and data APIs.</p>


    <p>Founded in 2006, ParkWhiz was formed out of the founders&#8217; frustration
    over finding a decent parking spot at a ballgame. Between the parking lots, garages,
    and driveway owners renting out space, there were plenty of places to park, but
    no way to know which had open spaces or how much they cost. There had to be a
    better way than driving around aimlessly searching for a spot.</p>


    <p>ParkWhiz.com presents a fast, efficient way for drivers to find available parking
    on their computer or mobile phone before they reach their destination. Parking
    search results reflect real-time parking availability at hundreds of ParkWhiz
    partner locations, enabling drivers to make a reservation and know for sure that
    a guaranteed parking spot will be waiting for them when they arrive. ParkWhiz
    carefully vets each parking location and provides detailed descriptions and customer
    reviews to ensure there are no surprises.</p>


    <p>ParkWhiz provides tools to help parking owners large and small earn more money
    from their parking spaces. With ParkWhiz&#8217;s innovative prepaid parking reservation
    system, parking owners can offer drivers a more convenient way to park their car,
    while gaining widespread exposure through ParkWhiz&#8217;s extensive Internet
    and smart-phone presence. ParkWhiz handles payment processing and fraud protection,
    making it effortless for parking owners to get started.</p>


    <p>Whether it&#8217;s a home owner earning extra cash by renting out driveway
    space or a parking company executive tasked with managing thousands of parking
    spaces, ParkWhiz makes it easy for parking owners to maximize their revenue while
    providing a superior parking experience for drivers.</p>'

    (2Pac, Notorious B.I.G., Jay-Z – even the beginning of the Torah..)</p>


    <p>Our aim is not to translate rap into “nerdspeak”, but rather to critique rap
    as poetry</p>


    <p>Anyone can create an account and start explaining rap. Highlight any line to
    explain it yourself, suggest changes to existing explanations, and put up your
    favorite new songs.</p>


    <p>If you make good contributions you&#8217;ll earn Rap IQ™, and if you spit true
    knowledge, eventually you&#8217;ll be able to edit anything on the site.. just
    like a hip-hop Wikipedia..</p>'

  :overview: ! '<p>Founded in 2007 with a mission of improving access to healthcare,
    <a href="http://www.zocdoc.com/" title="ZocDoc" rel="nofollow">ZocDoc</a> is the
    most convenient, free way to find a nearby health practitioner who accepts your
    insurance and instantly book an appointment online. The service, used by more
    than 2.5 million patients/month, currently serves 40 percent of the U.S. population
    across 1,700+ cities.</p>


    <p>With the service, patients avoid the hassle of waiting on hold, searching for
    a good doctor or wondering whether a doctor takes a particular insurance. Participating
    health practitioners benefit by attracting new patients and alleviating the productivity
    lost from last minute cancellations.</p>


    <p>In 2012, ZocDoc introduced its first major product since the company’s inception
    - ZocDoc Check-In. This feature allows patients to fill out their medical forms
    online in advance of their visit and saves the information for future visits as
    well. This capability, which was the #1 most requested feature to date, improves
    accuracy and convenience for patients and doctors alike.</p>


    <p>ZocDoc en Español, a Spanish-language version of the website and mobile app,
    is also available.</p>'
